## Project Overview
In this project, we explore the intersection of professional sports and data analytics by examining the compensation and performance trends of ten elite basketball players from 2005 to 2014 . Our goal is to use statistical programming to understand how financial investments made by franchises correlate with the actual output produced on the court.We begin by establishing a baseline using salary data from the 2015-2016 season and then transition into a deeper longitudinal study . Throughout this analysis, we utilize R to visualize trends and normalize data, allowing us to account for critical factors such as player injuries and varying workloads . By the end of this report, we aim to provide a clear picture of player efficiency and overall value.

## Dataset Overview

To perform this analysis, we utilize a multidimensional dataset structured into several matrices that track ten elite players over a ten-season period from 2005 to 2014 . We have organized this information into three primary categories to help us evaluate the relationship between pay and performance:

1.  **Financial Data**: We use annual **Salary** figures to establish the market valuation for each player .


**Matrix Salary**

```{}
Salary <- rbind(KobeBryant_Salary, JoeJohnson_Salary, LeBronJames_Salary, CarmeloAnthony_Salary, DwightHoward_Salary, ChrisBosh_Salary, ChrisPaul_Salary, KevinDurant_Salary, DerrickRose_Salary, DwayneWade_Salary)
rm(KobeBryant_Salary, JoeJohnson_Salary, CarmeloAnthony_Salary, DwightHoward_Salary, ChrisBosh_Salary, LeBronJames_Salary, ChrisPaul_Salary, DerrickRose_Salary, DwayneWade_Salary, KevinDurant_Salary)
colnames(Salary) <- Seasons
rownames(Salary) <- Players
```
**Output**

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("Code-b.png")
```




2.    **Availability & Workload**: We track **Games** played and **Minutes Played** to measure player durability and their actual time spent on the court.


**Matrix Games**
```{}
Games <- rbind(KobeBryant_G, JoeJohnson_G, LeBronJames_G, CarmeloAnthony_G, DwightHoward_G, ChrisBosh_G, ChrisPaul_G, KevinDurant_G, DerrickRose_G, DwayneWade_G)
rm(KobeBryant_G, JoeJohnson_G, CarmeloAnthony_G, DwightHoward_G, ChrisBosh_G, LeBronJames_G, ChrisPaul_G, DerrickRose_G, DwayneWade_G, KevinDurant_G)
colnames(Games) <- Seasons
rownames(Games) <- Players
```

**Output**

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("Code-g.png")
```

**Matrix Minutes Played**
```{}
MinutesPlayed <- rbind(KobeBryant_MP, JoeJohnson_MP, LeBronJames_MP, CarmeloAnthony_MP, DwightHoward_MP, ChrisBosh_MP, ChrisPaul_MP, KevinDurant_MP, DerrickRose_MP, DwayneWade_MP)
rm(KobeBryant_MP, JoeJohnson_MP, CarmeloAnthony_MP, DwightHoward_MP, ChrisBosh_MP, LeBronJames_MP, ChrisPaul_MP, DerrickRose_MP, DwayneWade_MP, KevinDurant_MP)
colnames(MinutesPlayed) <- Seasons
rownames(MinutesPlayed) <- Players
```

**Output**
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("Code-m.png")
```

3.    **Scoring Metrics**: we look at **Field Goals**, **Field Goal Attempts**, and total **Points** to determine shooting accuracy and overall offensive impact.


**Matrix Field Goals**

```{}
FieldGoals <- rbind(KobeBryant_FG, JoeJohnson_FG, LeBronJames_FG, CarmeloAnthony_FG, DwightHoward_FG, ChrisBosh_FG, ChrisPaul_FG, KevinDurant_FG, DerrickRose_FG, DwayneWade_FG)
rm(KobeBryant_FG, JoeJohnson_FG, LeBronJames_FG, CarmeloAnthony_FG, DwightHoward_FG, ChrisBosh_FG, ChrisPaul_FG, KevinDurant_FG, DerrickRose_FG, DwayneWade_FG)
colnames(FieldGoals) <- Seasons
rownames(FieldGoals) <- Players
```
**Output**
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("Code-f.png")
```


**Matrix Field Goal Attempts**
```{}
FieldGoalAttempts <- rbind(KobeBryant_FGA, JoeJohnson_FGA, LeBronJames_FGA, CarmeloAnthony_FGA, DwightHoward_FGA, ChrisBosh_FGA, ChrisPaul_FGA, KevinDurant_FGA, DerrickRose_FGA, DwayneWade_FGA)
rm(KobeBryant_FGA, JoeJohnson_FGA, LeBronJames_FGA, CarmeloAnthony_FGA, DwightHoward_FGA, ChrisBosh_FGA, ChrisPaul_FGA, KevinDurant_FGA, DerrickRose_FGA, DwayneWade_FGA)
colnames(FieldGoalAttempts) <- Seasons
rownames(FieldGoalAttempts) <- Players
```
**Output**
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("Code-a.png")
```


**Matrix Points**

```{}
Points <- rbind(KobeBryant_PTS, JoeJohnson_PTS, LeBronJames_PTS, CarmeloAnthony_PTS, DwightHoward_PTS, ChrisBosh_PTS, ChrisPaul_PTS, KevinDurant_PTS, DerrickRose_PTS, DwayneWade_PTS)
rm(KobeBryant_PTS, JoeJohnson_PTS, LeBronJames_PTS, CarmeloAnthony_PTS, DwightHoward_PTS, ChrisBosh_PTS, ChrisPaul_PTS, KevinDurant_PTS, DerrickRose_PTS, DwayneWade_PTS)
colnames(Points) <- Seasons
rownames(Points) <- Players
```
**Output**

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("Code-p.png")
```

By cross-referencing these categories, we can move beyond raw numbers to find a clearer picture of player efficiency and value.

## Programming Logic and Visualization Framework
To maintain a consistent and professional standard throughout our analysis, we developed a custom plotting function named **myplot**. This allows us to automate the visualization process and ensures that every chart follows the same formatting rules.

Here is a concise version of the merits section, optimized for a professional report:

## Technical Merits of the `myplot` Function

We developed the `myplot` function to streamline our analytical workflow and ensure visual consistency across the report .

**The primary advantages include:**

**Automated Transposition**: We integrated the `t()` function to automatically flip our data, ensuring seasons always align correctly on the x-axis for trend analysis .

**Standardized Visual Signature**: By hard-coding parameters like `pch = 15:18` and `col = c(1:4, 6)`, we ensure each player maintains a consistent color and symbol across every chart .

**Intelligent Subsetting**: The inclusion of the `drop = FALSE` parameter prevents the data structure from collapsing when we isolate an individual player's performance .

**Efficiency and Reproducibility**: We follow the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle, allowing us to generate complex normalized charts, such as `FieldGoals / Games`, with a single, standardized command.

**Code**

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("Rplot24.png")
```

### Analysis and Findings
In this section, we transition from data preparation to active visualization. By plotting the primary matrices, we can observe long-term trends in compensation and player activity.






**FieldGoals scored by each player **

```{}
myplot(FieldGoals, custom_label = "Field Goals Made")
```
**Output**
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("Rplot08.png")
```
**Analysis and Interpretation**

**Scoring Consistency:** This chart tracks the absolute offensive output of the ten players over the decade.

**Impact of Durability:** Sharp drops in the lines often correspond to seasons where players were sidelined by injury, most notably during the 2012 season.

**Performance Baseline:** While this graph shows who made the most shots, we must remember it is influenced by playing time; therefore, a more accurate efficiency measure would involve normalizing this against games played.




**Field Goals per Game**
```{}
myplot(FieldGoals / Games, custom_label = "Field Goals Per Game")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("Rplot09.png")
```


**Analysis and Interpretation**

**Scoring Consistency:** This chart tracks the absolute offensive output of the ten players over the decade.

**Impact of Durability:** Sharp drops in the lines often correspond to seasons where players were sidelined by injury, most notably during the 2012 season.

**Performance Baseline:** While this graph shows who made the most shots, we must remember it is influenced by playing time; therefore, a more accurate efficiency measure would involve normalizing this against games played.

To visualize the scoring efficiency of the players while accounting for injuries and missed time, we use the normalized metric of **Field Goals per Game** .
Interpretation and Insights

**Accurate Performance Tracking:** Visualizing raw Field Goals can be misleading if a player was injured; normalizing by Games provides a more accurate representation of their nightly impact .


**Identifying Offensive Powerhouses:** This chart reveals who the most consistent scorers were every time they stepped onto the court, regardless of how many games they played in a season .


**Resilience to Anomalies:** By using this ratio, we can see that elite players like LeBron James often maintain a steady line even during the 2012 season, whereas their raw totals would show a significant dip .

**Reliability Metrics:** A flat or rising line in this graph indicates a player who remained a primary scoring threat throughout their career, even as their physical durability might have fluctuated.

**To check the accuracy of the shots for each player visualization** 
```{}
myplot(FieldGoals / FieldGoalAttempts, custom_label = "Shooting Accuracy (%)")
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("Rplot10.png")
```
**Interpretation and Insights**

Technical Efficiency: This chart provides a direct look at a player's technical skill, showing the percentage of shots that actually result in points .

**Style Identification:** Players with consistently high lines (often above 0.50) are typically high-efficiency scorers who take high-probability shots, such as Dwight Howard.


**Performance Stability:** By normalizing the data, we can see which players maintained their accuracy over a decade, even as their total volume of shots changed due to aging or role shifts .


**Comparative Precision:** This visualization allows us to differentiate between "high-volume" scorers (who take many shots) and "high-accuracy" scorers (who make a higher percentage of the shots they take)


**Minutes played for all the players**

```{}
myplot(MinutesPlayed, custom_label = "Total Minutes Played")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("Rplot11.png")
```

If you wish to have visualization only for top three players (subsetting), then follow below

```{}
myplot(MinutesPlayed, rows = 1:3, custom_label = "Minutes Played (Top 3)")
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("Rplot12.png")
```
In case, if you wish to have only the first player data visualization 

```{}
myplot(MinutesPlayed, rows = 1, custom_label = "Career Minutes: Kobe Bryant")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("Rplot13.png")
```

**Interpretation and Insights**

**Workload Trends:** This visualization tracks the total time players spent on the court, which is a direct indicator of their importance to the team and their physical stamina .


**Injury Correlation:** Significant drops in the lines indicate seasons where players were sidelined for extended periods, as seen in the sharp decline for Derrick Rose in 2012.

**Career Longevity:** By observing the slope of the lines toward the later seasons (2013–2014), we can identify players whose roles began to diminish or who maintained elite levels of activity despite aging.

**Baseline for Efficiency:** While total minutes show the "quantity" of play, we often use this as a denominator for more advanced metrics like "Points per Minute" to find the true "quality" of a player's time on the court .

**Visual Clarity:** Removing the other seven players reduces "visual noise," making the shapes (pch = 15:18) and colors (col = 1:3) much easier to track across the ten-season timeline .


**MinutesPlayed**
```
myplot(MinutesPlayed, custom_label = "Total Minutes Played")
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("Rplot14.png")
```
**Interpretation and Insights**

**Workload Trends:** This visualization tracks the total time players spent on the court, which is a direct indicator of their importance to the team and their physical stamina.


**Injury Correlation:** Significant drops in the lines indicate seasons where players were sidelined for extended periods, as seen in the sharp decline for Derrick Rose in 2012.

**Career Longevity:** By observing the slope of the lines toward the later seasons (2013–2014), we can identify players whose roles began to diminish or who maintained elite levels of activity despite aging.


**Baseline for Efficiency:** While total minutes show the "quantity" of play, we often use this as a denominator for more advanced metrics like "Field Goals per Minute" to find the true "quality" of a player's time on the court.


**MinutesPlayed / Games**

```{}
myplot(MinutesPlayed / Games, custom_label = "Minutes Played Per Game")
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("Rplot15.png")
```

**MinutesPlayed / Games for player number 3!**

```{}
myplot(MinutesPlayed / Games, rows = 3, custom_label = "Minutes Per Game: LeBron James")
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("Rplot16.png")
```

**Interpretation and Insights**

**Average Demand:** This metric provides a clearer picture of a player's role on the team, distinguishing between high-minute starters and those with more managed workloads.

**Stamina and Management:** We can observe how coaching strategies evolve over a player's career. A declining trend in this chart may indicate "load management" as elite players age to preserve their longevity .


**Role Consistency:** For many elite players, the line remains relatively stable near the 35–40 minute mark, showcasing their status as indispensable "workhorses" for their franchises .

**Injury Impact:** Unlike raw minutes, this per-game metric remains informative even for seasons with low game counts, as it shows the intensity of the player's contribution whenever they were healthy enough to compete.

**Elite Workload Management:** The visualization for LeBron James shows a remarkably high but gradually managed workload . Starting at over 42 minutes per game in 2005, his nightly time was strategically reduced to approximately 36–37 minutes by 2014 to preserve his physical longevity .


**Games Played (Durability)**

```{}
myplot(Games)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("Rplot06.png")
```

**Interpretation and Insights**

**Measuring Durability:** This chart identifies which players were "iron men" (consistently playing 80+ games) and which players faced frequent physical setbacks.


**The 2011/2012 Outlier:** You will notice a collective dip for almost all players during the 2011 season. This represents the NBA lockout, which resulted in a shortened 66-game schedule, rather than individual injuries.


**Injury Analysis:** Sharp, isolated drops—such as Derrick Rose's 0-game season in 2012 or Kobe Bryant's 6-game season in 2013—highlight career-altering injuries that impacted their overall career stats.


**Aging Curve:** As we move toward the 2014 season, many elite players show more volatility in their game counts, reflecting the natural physical decline and the transition into the "veteran" stage of their careers.

**Financial Efficiency: Salary per Point**
```{}
myplot(Salary / Points, custom_label = "USD Spent per Point Scored")
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("Rplot17.png")
```
**Interpretation:** A lower line in this chart is actually "better" for the team's management, as it indicates a player who produces a high volume of points at a relatively lower cost.

**Insight:** You might notice that younger superstars (like Kevin Durant in his early years) often have very low lines here because they score heavily while still on their initial, lower-paying contracts.


**Technical Discipline: Field Goals per Minute**
```{}
myplot(FieldGoals / MinutesPlayed, custom_label = "Field Goals per Minute")
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("Rplot18.png")
```
**Interpretation:** This removes the bias of players who play "garbage time" or long minutes just to pad their stats.


**Insight:** If a player's line is rising while their total MinutesPlayed is falling, it shows they are becoming a more specialized and efficient "pure scorer" as they age.

**Strategic Style: Points per Field Goal**
This identifies a player's "Scoring Style". It helps us differentiate between "slashers" and "shooters"
```{}
myplot(Points / FieldGoals, custom_label = "Points per Made Shot")
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("Rplot19.png")
```
**Interpretation:** A value close to 2.0 indicates a player who scores primarily through layups and mid-range jump shots.


**Insight:** A value closer to 3.0 indicates a high-value perimeter shooter who focuses on three-pointers and drawing fouls for free throws.



**Relative Workload: Field Goal Attempts per Game**
While FieldGoals/Games shows success, this metric shows "aggression".
```{}
myplot(FieldGoalAttempts / Games, custom_label = "Shooting Attempts per Night")
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("Rplot20.png")
```
**Interpretation:** This tells you who the "Alpha" player is on the team—the one who the coach trusts to take the shot, regardless of whether it goes in or not.


**Insight:** Significant drops here can signal a change in team dynamics, such as a player moving to a new team where they have to share the ball with other stars (like LeBron James moving to Miami in 2010).

**Time Value Analysis**
Instead of looking at games or total minutes, we look at the immediate impact per unit of time .

**Field Goals per Minute**
```{}
myplot(FieldGoals / MinutesPlayed, custom_label = "Field Goals per Minute")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("Rplot21.png")
```
**Interpretation:** This visualization reveals who is the most dangerous scorer while on the clock. It filters out "empty minutes" and identifies players who are highly productive even in short bursts

**Scoring Style & Role Definition**
These metrics help define the "Archetype" of the player (e.g., Slasher, Long-range Shooter, or Free-throw Specialist).

**Points per Field Goal**
```{}
myplot(Points / FieldGoals, custom_label = "Points per Made Shot")
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("Rplot22.png")
```
**Interpretation:** This identifies how a player scores. A score near 2.0 indicates a traditional interior player, while a score closer to 3.0 indicates a heavy reliance on three-pointers and free throws.

**Field Goal Attempts per Game**
```{}
myplot(FieldGoalAttempts / Games, custom_label = "Daily Shooting Volume")
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("Rplot23.png")
```

**Interpretation:** This measures a player's "Usage Rate" or aggression. It shows which players the team relies on to take the most shots every night, regardless of their accuracy.

**Interpretation: Correlation between Total Salary and Total Points**
```{}
myplot(Salary, data2 = Points, type = "correlation", custom_label = "Salary")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("Rplot25.png")
```
**Core Findings**

**The Trend Line:** Represents "Fair Market Value"; players near this line are paid proportionally to their production .

**High-Value Bargains (Above Line):** These players are under-compensated for their elite output, making them the most efficient assets for a franchise .


**Overpaid Assets (Below Line):** These players represent financial inefficiency, often receiving high "Max Contracts" despite lower cumulative production due to age or injury.

**Cumulative Performance Analysis (Bar Graph)**
```{}
myplot(Points, type = "total", custom_label = "Career Points Scored")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("Rplot26.png")
```
**Analysis and Interpretation:**

Absolute Value: While line charts show consistency, this bar graph highlights the total offensive volume provided by each player.


Production Leaders: It allows for a quick comparison of which "assets" generated the highest cumulative output for their teams during the study period.

**Cumulative Financial Analysis (Bar Graph)**
```{}
myplot(Salary, type = "total", custom_label = "Salary Investment")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("Rplot27.png")
```

**Analysis and Interpretation:**


**Investment Hierarchy:** This bar graph provides a clear ranking of total financial commitment per player from 2005 to 2014.

**Budgetary Impact:** It identifies which athletes have consumed the largest portion of franchise resources over the long term, moving beyond year-by-year fluctuations.

**Distribution of Salaries (Boxplot)**
```{}
boxplot(Salary, las = 2, col = "orange", main = "Distribution of Salaries (2005-2014)", ylab = "Salary in USD")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("Rplot28.png")
```
**Core Insights**
**Pay Dispersion:** The increasing height of the boxes over time indicates a growing pay gap among elite players, showing that the market is valuing "top-tier" superstars significantly higher than their peers each year.


**Median Growth:** The rising horizontal lines within each box track the steady inflation of the "average elite salary," reflecting the league's overall revenue growth from 2005 to 2014.


**Market Outliers:** Points outside the "whiskers" identify extreme valuations, highlighting seasons where specific players (like Kobe Bryant) received compensation packages far exceeding the standard distribution.

**Performance Index Visualization (Heatmap)**
```{}
heatmap(Points, Rowv = NA, Colv = NA, col = cm.colors(256), scale = "column", margins = c(5,10),
        main = "Performance Index: Scoring Intensity Heatmap")
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("Rplot29.png")
```

**Core Insights**
**Performance Index Mapping:** The heatmap converts raw point totals into color intensity, allowing for an immediate "Performance Index" comparison between players and seasons at a single glance.

**Identifying Peak Performance:** Intense color blocks highlight "peak performance" years, answering the core analytical question of which seasons show the strongest performance trends across the league.

**Consistency Visualizer:** Players with long, unbroken stretches of high-intensity color are identified as the most consistent performers, while lighter blocks pinpoint performance variability or seasons affected by injury.

**League-Wide Shifts:** Vertical columns reveal broader year-over-year trends, showing specific eras where the entire elite group experienced a scoring surge versus collective defensive-heavy years.

**Player Consistency Plot (PPG Variability)**
```{}
PPG <- Points / Games
# Use a line plot to see who has the 'flattest' line (most consistent)
myplot(PPG, custom_label = "Points Per Game Consistency")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("Rplot30.png")
```
**Core Insights**
**Normalized Reliability:** By dividing Points by Games, this chart eliminates the "noise" caused by injuries or the 2011 lockout, revealing a player's true nightly offensive impact.

**Identifying "The Iron Man":** A "flat" line across the ten seasons identifies the most consistent performers—players who guarantee a specific scoring output every time they step onto the court, regardless of external factors.

**Growth Trajectories:** Rising slopes in this visualization highlight players who "improved most over time," transitioning from secondary roles into elite "Alpha" scorers.

**Performance Stability:** Significant "dips" or "peaks" in this chart (unlike raw totals) reflect genuine changes in a player's skill level or team role, rather than just games missed.

## Executive Summary: Pay vs. Performance in Professional Basketball (2005–2014)

This analysis provides a comprehensive evaluation of ten elite basketball players, examining the complex relationship between their market valuation and on-court efficiency. By utilizing a custom-built analytical framework in R, we transitioned from raw data to normalized metrics to uncover the true value each athlete provides to their franchise.

### **Key Analytical Pillars**

**1. Financial ROI and Market Valuation**
The study tracks the significant upward trajectory of salaries, reaching a baseline peak in the 2015-2016 season with stars like Kobe Bryant earning over **$25 million** annually. However, when normalized as **"Salary per Point,"** we identified that younger superstars often provide superior financial value, producing high output while still on initial, lower-paying contracts.

**2. Durability and Availability**
Player durability remains a critical risk factor for any franchise. While "iron men" consistently played **80+ games**, the data clearly highlights career-altering injuries—such as Derrick Rose’s missed 2012 season—and the collective impact of the **2011 NBA Lockout**, which skewed absolute performance totals.

**3. Operational Efficiency and Scoring Style**
By moving beyond raw scoring, our analysis differentiated between "high-volume" shooters and "high-accuracy" specialists.

* 
**Technical Precision**: Players like Dwight Howard maintained high **Shooting Accuracy** (often above 50%) by focusing on high-probability interior shots.


* 
**Archetype Identification**: Using the **"Points per Made Shot"** metric, we categorized players into "Slashers" (near 2.0) and "Perimeter Specialists" (near 3.0), providing deep insight into various offensive roles and "Alpha" aggression levels.



**4. Workload Management**
A significant finding in player longevity is the shift toward **"Load Management."** This is most evident in LeBron James’s career arc, where his nightly workload was strategically reduced from **42 minutes to 36 minutes** per game to preserve his elite output over the long term.

### **Final Conclusion**

The intersection of data and sports reveals that the most valuable "assets" are not necessarily the highest-paid, but those who maintain high **Technical Efficiency** and **Points per Minute** while managing physical durability. This report demonstrates that through statistical normalization, franchises can better quantify the "Value for Money" and strategic impact of elite talent in a highly volatile market.
